#### Note on license
These calendars don't seem to have a proper license on 365done.ru. It says: "one can use calendars for personal use with credit to the authors". I added some modifications: 366 days instead of 365, and Fediverse reference. If you're the author and wish these modified versions to be removed, please, open an issue and it will be done.
